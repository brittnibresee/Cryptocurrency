## Unsupervised machine learning and Cryptocurrency

#Crypto Clustering overview:

This project involves using unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their 24-hour and 7-day price changes. And K-means algorithm for clustering Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize the clusters. 
The Scikit-learn library for data preparation and modeling.
